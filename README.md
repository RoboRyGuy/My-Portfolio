# My-Portfolio
 A list of all the languages and platforms I have used before:
1. C/C++ (Console and Win32)
2. Java (Hackerrank)
3. Python (Mostly through Renpy, which is related to pygame)
4. C# (Mostly in Unity)
5. Visual Basic (Prerequisite in school)
6. Lua (Lots of programs use it for customizability)
7. HTML and CSS (Web Design Class)
