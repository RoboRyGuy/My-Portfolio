# My-Portfolio
 A list of all the languages and platforms I have used before:
1. C/C++ (Console and Win32)
2. Python (Mostly through Renpy, which is related to pygame)
3. C# (Mostly in Unity)
4. Visual Basic (For school purposes)
5. Lua (Lots of programs use it for customizability)
6. HTML and CSS (Web Design Class)
