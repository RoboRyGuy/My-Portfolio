This project represents a type of work I dislike: Container adapters.
I recognize the use of container adapters as a quick fix, but believe 
 that they're inefficient in the long run.
This project could be better done with a linked circular list;
however, due to this being a school project, I did not have that choice.
I leave this here to demonstrate ability to create container adapters.
The language is C++, opens in Visual Studio 2017.
