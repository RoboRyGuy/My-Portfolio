This project demonstrates understanding and ability to use a basic binary tree. 
 This one isn't self balancing (I know the theory, but haven't made one yet),
 but it does cover all the other bases. I also put a fair amount of work into
 redoing the tree display function, so that may also be worth considering.
The language is C, and it opens in Visual Studio 2017.
