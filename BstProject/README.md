This is a binary search tree project done for school, built on a small template.
 This demonstrates knowledge in creating and using binary search trees.
 This tree isn't self balancing (I know the theory, haven't tried it yet),
 but it does cover all the other bases. I also put a fair amount of work into
 redoing the tree display function, so that may also be worth considering.
The language is C, and it opens in Visual Studio 2017.
