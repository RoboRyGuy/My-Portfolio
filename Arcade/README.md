This file is a zipped Renpy working directory. For some warning, this is
 from when I just started coding, and is messy compared to my newer work.
 
Contained in this game is three simpler games: snake and two versions of pacman.
 The snake game is based on an online javascript version I liked 
 (Credit: http://www.menet.umn.edu/~dockt036/snake.html). It's a complete game
 
The pacman games are more complex. The first version was my first attempt at AI,
 collision detection, and other such things. It's kinda messy code-wise, but it's
 a mostly flushed-out game, with only a few missing elements from the original,
 and minimal bugs. The second version is an attempt at cleaning up the original 
 that never got quite finished. Its code is cleaner, more versatile, but the game
 is a little buggier.
 
To use the orignal code, you need to download renpy (free). You can veiw / edit the
 .rpy (script) files in any standard text editor. You only need renpy to compile and run.

That's a pain, though, so I went ahead and created 3 distributions
 available on my google drive at 
 https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/169mM_8tQiU_vG84ExY7O7EcwrYEx85ni?usp=sharing
 The Snake game is snake, the Pacman game the first mentioned iteration of pacman,
 and the RainbowPacman game is the second iteration showcasing its new versatility.
 Notably, I disabled death in RainbowPacman due to how easy it is to die.
