This is a silly little project I made on request by a friend.
I never had a chance to finish it, since school started back up.
I will start off with a warning: For whatever reason, Visual Studio
 has made it nearly impossible for me to use images in Win32 projects.
This means they did not upload correctly, and the project will not work.
I uploaded the project regardless in order to demonstrate ability to work
 around the bitwise limitations of Win32 to create semitransparent sprites.
The language is C++, and it opens in Visual Studio 2017.


IF YOU WANNA SEE IT WORK: Download the project, take the two .bmp files, and throw
 them in your downloads folder. Then, in Visual Studio, open the file WndProc.cpp.
 Near the beginning there are two strings, file locations. Change the word joe to
 your username, and it should all work fine.

I understand this is a lot of work, but I have yet to figure out Visual Studio's
 Win32 images system. Win32 is becoming depreciated, so accurate documentation is slim.
