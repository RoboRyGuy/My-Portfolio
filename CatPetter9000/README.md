This is a silly little project I made on request by a friend.
I never had a chance to finish it, since school started back up.
I will start off with a warning: For whatever reason, Visual Studio
 has made it nearly impossible for me to use images in Win32 projects.
This means they did not upload correctly, and the project will not work.
I uploaded the project regardless in order to demonstrate ability to work
 around the bitwise limitations of Win32 to create semitransparent sprites.
The language is C++, and it opens in Visual Studio 2017.
